n Minecraft, we can build a whole new world with our customized structures, such as houses, castles, huts, towers, and creatures. Also, we can discover the endless world of Minecraft.

The game is simple in design, but the open world offers endless possibilities. It is a unique way to engage kids in STEM learning too.

Players have access to block based worlds where they must survive, build, and craft to make their way in a completely randomly generated world. 

If survival mode isn’t for you, then you may enjoy creative mode. There, players can choose to spawn into the world with a near infinite amount of resources to build whatever they want. 

Minecraft truly enables players to open up their imaginations and create extraordinary things.
As such, the game can be easily adapted for educational purposes and can provide many benefits to students of all ages! 


Encourage Creativity
The creative mode of Minecraft is just like building with LEGO Bricks, Lincoln Logs and Tinker Toys.

It is essentially a bucket of virtual pieces to engineer whatever you want. However, Minecraft provides a near-infinite amount of every one of its blocks and objects.


Players can really build whatever they want while letting their imagination go wild. They aren’t limited by the number of pieces or by physical space for building. 

Virtual Learning Opportunities
Many students are visual learners, but it can be hard to procure visual aids for many subjects. Sometimes, flat 2-D pictures don’t cut it either.

However, with Minecraft, parents and teachers can create 3-D models of nearly anything for students to explore.

Geography, biology, science, and even history can all be explored through Minecraft. 

For example, my son built a castle while looking at pictures of castles in Scotland. He’s also spent time looking up the flags of other countries and creating them in game as well.

Drawing Tools: At the top, you have the five drawing tools. From left to right, they are:
(1) Pencil: Paint one block at a time in a solid color.
(2) Texture Brush: Paint one block at a time while slightly changing the color to give
you the “Minecraft” look (gradient effect).
(3) Eraser: Erase what you’ve made.
(4) Paint Bucket: Fill in solid areas with a single color.
(5) Eyedropper: Select a color that’s already on the skin, which you can then use to
paint.

teacher:
Step 1: Copy the URL shared by the student.
Step 2: Click on C and open the code builder.
Step 3: Click on the Microsoft MakeCode Editor.(go to home-in left side)
Step 4: On the right side of my projects you see the import option,

-----------------------
With coding, we can make so many magical changes in the Minecraft world.
- We created our own custom skin using pallets and tools.
- We learned to provide instructions to the computer in the language the computer understands.
- We learned how to make the player glide through the air and give more power using an enchanted book.
- We learned how to create a simple customized (custom-made) command and how to make the player teleport
from one World to another

We all know that Minecraft is a very popular game and kids simply love Minecraft because they can truly build anything they imagine. 

The open-ended feature of the game has created a culture of makers who dream up to make new things and then learn the perseverance to bring them to life. 

 kids can simply learn to make changes in their own Minecraft world through two platforms,
 
 which are: ● Microsoft MakeCode. ● Tynker Modding. 
 
 This will enhance Logical and Analytical skills as will apply programming fundamentals such as conditionals, functions, repetitions, variables, sequences, etc. 
 
The Benefit to learn coding with Minecraft: 

- 1. Immersive experience-3D Modeling and Design- While kids design their own 3D player, the mobs (elephants/horses, etc.) can be designed using the 3D Tynker tool editor in a fun way. 

- 2. Sparks creativity- Unlike other games where you play the game using predefined rules, here it is all about building something unique and creating your own Minecraft Masterpiece.
- 
-  3. Easy to get started- Minecraft has a block-based creative mode which is extremely simple. You can build anything using the blocks just like Lego. 
-  4. Great way to encourage and motivate your kid to get into coding - Any popular Minecraft game can also be modified to create your own custom game. 
This is popularly called ‘Modding’. As kids build mods and create addons for Minecraft, they learn to code, think critically, and write programs.
They start seeing coding as a tool that they can use to bring anything in their imagination to life. 

5. Encourages collaboration- Friends start playing the Minecraft game your child has created and they start adding their own touch to it and collaborate together in their private and secured server thereby learning collaboration and communication skills.

you will get:
1.own private Minecraft credentials to create and test the mods
2. Modding on the Tynker and Microsoft MakeCode Platform is very easy as it eliminates the need to compile Java files, set up servers, or open network ports for friends.It allows us to rapidly create the mods and deploy them on the Minecraft server with a single-click. 
3. A unique block-based visual coding approach eliminates frustration for beginners

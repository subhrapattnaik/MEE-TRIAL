-----------------------
With coding, we can make so many magical changes in the Minecraft world.
- We created our own custom skin using pallets and tools.
- We learned to provide instructions to the computer in the language the computer understands.
- We learned how to make the player glide through the air and give more power using an enchanted book.
- We learned how to create a simple customized (custom-made) command and how to make the player teleport
from one World to another

We all know that Minecraft is a very popular game and kids simply love Minecraft because they can truly build anything they imagine. 

The open-ended feature of the game has created a culture of makers who dream up to make new things and then learn the perseverance to bring them to life. 

 kids can simply learn to make changes in their own Minecraft world through two platforms,
 
 which are: ● Microsoft MakeCode. ● Tynker Modding. 
 
 This will enhance Logical and Analytical skills as will apply programming fundamentals such as conditionals, functions, repetitions, variables, sequences, etc. 
 
The Benefit to learn coding with Minecraft: 

- 1. Immersive experience-3D Modeling and Design- While kids design their own 3D player, the mobs (elephants/horses, etc.) can be designed using the 3D Tynker tool editor in a fun way. 

- 2. Sparks creativity- Unlike other games where you play the game using predefined rules, here it is all about building something unique and creating your own Minecraft Masterpiece.
- 
-  3. Easy to get started- Minecraft has a block-based creative mode which is extremely simple. You can build anything using the blocks just like Lego. 
-  4. Great way to encourage and motivate your kid to get into coding - Any popular Minecraft game can also be modified to create your own custom game. 
This is popularly called ‘Modding’. As kids build mods and create addons for Minecraft, they learn to code, think critically, and write programs.
They start seeing coding as a tool that they can use to bring anything in their imagination to life. 

5. Encourages collaboration- Friends start playing the Minecraft game your child has created and they start adding their own touch to it and collaborate together in their private and secured server thereby learning collaboration and communication skills.

you will get:
1.own private Minecraft credentials to create and test the mods
2. Modding on the Tynker and Microsoft MakeCode Platform is very easy as it eliminates the need to compile Java files, set up servers, or open network ports for friends.It allows us to rapidly create the mods and deploy them on the Minecraft server with a single-click. 
3. A unique block-based visual coding approach eliminates frustration for beginners
